""" Rubberband cars (Elastic Potential Energy, distance, and arc-length calculation"""

VOD: "Introduction to Elastic Potential Energy with Examples" : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZnpsCV2GSY

-elastic potential energy, how rubber bands store energy when moved
-Formula: (PE_e) = (1/2) kx^2
    -PE_e: is the elastic potential energy
    -k: is the spring Constant in (Newtons/meters)
    -x: is displacement from equilibrium

-the spring constant can be thought of as the force required to move the thing from equilibrium
    -can also be thought of as the slope of a graph drawn between: newtons(y), and distance from equilibrium in meters (x).
        -in such a graph the y intercept would be 0, and the rate of change between the two shoudl be linear
    -the more distance add to the object the more potential energy it gains

-for the elastic potential energy formual, you should get after all is said and done a value in the units N*m
    -Newton * meters = Joules
    -Joules can also be represented by: J = (kg * (m^2)) / (s^2)
        -this is kilograms times squared meters, divided by the squared seconds

-so we can get joules out of this equation if we know the:
    -Spring constant:
    -displacement from equilibrium:

-if we know the potential energy in joules can we then just put that value into the kenetic energy in joules?
    -yes because they are the same energy is measured in Joules
    -and if we know the mass of the car, we can then calulate how far it will go?
        -we can't really calculate that without knowing some other information

VOD: "Determining the Spring Constant, k, with a vertically hanging mass"
    -this might be a way that I could calculate the spring constant and then the elastic potential energy of people's rubber bands
 
    -to do this:
        -measure the length of the rubberband at its "normal length": maybe streatch it out a little
        -then hang weight from the rubber band
        -measure the length of the rubberband while it's under stress
        -now calculate:
     
    -first you want teh units to match so, meters, and kilograms

    -equation for a spring force: F_s = -kx
        -k: spring const
        -x: displacement from equalibrium position
        -fyi the spring force will be up, because it's counteracting the force of gravity pulling down

    -Newtons Second Law: Sigma F_y = F_s - F_g
        -the net force in the y direction is equal to the springforce minus the force of gravity
        -also: Sigma F_y = m a_y
            -net force is equal to the mass times acceleration in the y direction
                -the object is not moving, so ( mass times 0 = 0)
        -Sigma F_y = 0
        -F_s and F_g are equal
            - F_s = F_g
    
    -Substitute Equations:
        -F_s = -kx 
        -F_g = mg
        -(kx = mg)
            -btw there is no need for the negative anymore
            -we are trying to find k so...
        -k = (mg)/x
            -m: mass is 
            -g: acceleration due to gravity
                -acceleration due to gravity: g = G*M/R^2
                    -g: acceleration due to gravity: (9.81) a bit different depending on where you go
                    -G: universal gravitational constant
                    -M: mass
                    -R: distance
            -x: final length - initial length, make sure it's positive
        
    -complete: make sure that your answer is in Newtons per meter
        -

    -my example:
        -5oz weight
        -2 (3/4) inch rubber band
        -4 (1/4) inch under weight
